This is an example sketch for STM32, that shows how to control
SimpleBGC-driven gimbal via Serial API. API specs are available at
[SerialAPI](http://www.basecamelectronics.com/serialapi/)

*Note: This project has been built with an arm-none-eabi toolchain and mingw32-make builder.*
*C compiler = arm-none-eabi-gcc; C++ compiler = arm-none-eabi-g++*
